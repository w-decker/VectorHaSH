# Episodic and associative memory from spatial scaffolds in the hippocampus

This is a fork of the official implementation of [Episodic and associative memory from spatial scaffolds in the hippocampus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08392-y). In this code we implement Vector-HaSH (Vector Hippocampal Scaffolded Heteroassociative Memory), a neocortical-entorhinal-hippocampal network that implements a high-capacity general associative memory, spatial memory and episodic memory.

The folders have been restructured as such:

The critical codebase exists in `src/`.
